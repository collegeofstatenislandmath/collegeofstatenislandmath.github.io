Cryptology is the study of the principles, techniques, other uses, and history of cryptography. This includes cryptanalysis, the study of breaking encryption schemes and finding weaknesses in security. In this course, the student will learn several historical cryptosystems and the modern math one would use to break them.

Starting with the problem of how to estimate unknown quantities, and the ways that we can describe the quality of our estimators, the course continues to a formal theory of hypothesis testing and derives most tests that occur in a practical statistics course directly from properties of estimators and tests generated from them.\n\nMany statistics courses will tell you *how* to test a claim using data.

Introduction to Galois theory.\n\n* [MTH 445](https://csi-undergraduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/1300951) *Differential Geometry*\n\n\nDifferential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the\nmethods of differential and integral calculus to study problems in\ngeometry.\n\nUsing the analytical tools of calculus, Euler and Lagrange were able\nto understand what are the curves on a surface that minimize the\ndistance between two points. A main question is how those curves can\nbe determined by using intrinsic measurement of the surfaces. In that\ndirection, Gauss in 1825 made some fundamental contributions to theory\nof surfaces. His papers contain practical calculations of the\ncurvature of the earth based purely on measurements made on the\nsurface. He considered also properties of surfaces which are\ndetermined only by the geodesic distances between points on the\nsurface independently of the particular way in which the surface is\nlocated in the ambient Euclidean space. This led to his Theorema\nEgregium, a fundamental result which explains why there cannot be an\naccurate planar map of the world.\n\n![Catenoid](../../images/images/catenoid.png)\n![Soap bubble](../../images/images/soap-bubble.png)\n\n\nDifferential Geometry allows also to explain and describe the\nbeautiful surfaces created by playing with soap bubbles. They are in\nfact examples of \"minimal surfaces\", a family of geometrical object\nthat turns out to be quite relevant in applications. The above picture\nis the famous “catenoid” already studied by Euler.\n\nIn the applied world, Differential Geometry allows to design shapes\nused in everyday life, and is helpful when looking for a minimal path\non curved surfaces. In physics, it allows to describe complicated\nphysical systems leading to the Lagrangian formalism and General\nRelativity. The success of these theories makes Differential Geometry\none of the fundamental tools in modern physics.\n\n\n\n## Pure Mathematics Emphasis\n\n\nStudents who wish to focus on theoretical aspects of mathematics are advised to include courses from Differential Equations, Real and Complex Analysis (MTH 331, MTH 342, MTH 431), Number Theory and Algebra (MTH 347, MTH 442), Geometry and Topology (MTH 329, MTH 441), or Logic and Foundations (MTH 350, MTH 440).\n\n## Applied Mathematics Emphasis\n\nStudents who wish to explore mathematical topics that have applications to other fields, including sciences, engineering, medicine, economics, or business, are advised to include courses that emphasize Mathematical Modeling such as Combinatorics/Graph Theory, Actuarial Mathematics, Operations Research and Mathematical Biology (MTH 337, MTH 360, MTH 370, MTH 415), Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems (MTH 331, MTH 435), Numerical Analysis (MTH 335), Mathematical Statistics (MTH 410, MTH 411), or Mathematics of Finance (MTH 416).\n\n## Honors\n\nTo graduate with honors in Mathematics a student must have at least a 3.5 grade point average in Mathematics courses and must complete an honors thesis or project.
