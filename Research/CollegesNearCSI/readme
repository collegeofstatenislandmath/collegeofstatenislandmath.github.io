  This list is dramatically incomplete, and the maintainer (obryant at
  gmail dot com) would appreciate any additions. The criteria is that the
  school must be accredited and must have a faculty member with
  mathematics publications. Drive times were generated by Google maps,
  and do not account for public transportation, traffic, construction, et
  cetera.
