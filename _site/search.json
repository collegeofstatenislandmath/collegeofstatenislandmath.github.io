Much of this research is closely connected with mathematical physics, and many results are of interest to biologists. For such a rich field of mathematical ideas, the “price of admission” is low for great undergraduate research projects.\nMy current research is motivated by a deep open problem: how to bridge the chasm between quantum and geometric topology. Thurston established the importance of geometric invariants, especially hyperbolic volume, in low-dimensional topology. A revolution in knot theory was ushered in with the discovery of the Jones polynomial in 1984, which led to vast families of quantum invariants. My aim is to establish the relationship between quantum invariants of a knot, such as the Jones polynomial, and the geometry of the knot complement.\nDr. Kofman is a member of a Focused Research Group (FRG) that received an NSF-FRG grant for collaborative research on topics in geometric topology. With this funding, Dr. Kofman has co-organized three major international conferences, with a special focus on the Volume Conjecture. Dr. Kofman earned his Ph.D. at the University of Maryland at College Park in 2000, and came to CSI after four years as a postdoc at Columbia University and Barnard College. He earned an Sc.B. in Mathematics at Brown University. Dr. Kofman is a co-organizer of the Geometric Topology seminar at the CUNY Graduate Center.

    "text": "Delayed reaction-diffusion PDE coupled to difference equation\nOn Monday March 6th at 11:00am, Prof. Abdennasser CHEKROUN will give a seminar in the Department of Mathematics Conference Room, Rm. 1S-213.\nABSTRACT:\nWe consider a class of biological models represented by a system composed of reaction-diffusion PDE\ncoupled with difference equations (renewal equations) in n-dimensional space, with nonlocal dispersal\nterms and implicit time delays. The difference equation generally arises, by means of the method of\ncharacteristics, from an age-structured partial differential system. Using upper and lower solutions,\nwe study the existence of monotonic planar traveling wave fronts connecting the extinction state to the\nuniform positive state. The corresponding minimum wave speed is also obtained. In addition,\nwe investigate the effect of the parameters on this minimum wave speed and we give a detailed analysis of\nits asymptotic behavior. Before all of that, for the presentation to be suitable for the unfamiliar but\nalso for young researchers with these notions, I would like to introduce the concept of traveling waves\nby using more basic equations.\nAbdennasser Chekroun is a mathematician specializing in delayed differential equations and conducts\nresearch on cell modeling and the modeling of certain epidemiological phenomena. Abdennasser CHEKROUN\nstudied mathematics at the University of Tlemcen (Algeria) and obtained a doctorate from the\nUniversity of Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (France) in 2016. He is currently a professor at the\nUniversity of Tlemcen and a member of the research laboratory in Non-Linear Analysis and\nApplied Mathematics (Tlemcen). Abdennasser CHEKROUN’s research focuses on analysis, dynamic systems,\nand applications. His main research themes are delay differential equations, reaction-diffusion equations\nwith delay and traveling wavefronts, and mathematical modeling. He is also the first winner of the Audin\nchair of the Insmi (National Institute of Mathematical Sciences and their interactions) in 2020."

    "text": "The Undergraduate Catalog lists the requirements of the Math Major. The Catalog also lists the requirements of the Math Minor.\nHere we describe the requirements more informally.\n\n\nBoth the Math Major and Minor require a student to complete the pre-major requirements. These include the calculus sequence, a computer science or statistics course.\nThe major has some expectations on how a student fulfills their general education requirements. In particular there is an expectation of a one-year science course chosen from a select list.\n\n\n\nThe Bachelor in Science of Mathematics and Mathematics 7-12 Bachelor of Science degrees are available. The latter requires an additional 24 credits in an Education Sequence and some required elective upper-level courses (below).\n\n\nTo earn a Major in Mathematics there is an expectation of nine upper-level math courses beyond the pre-major. Six of these courses are required and described below. These courses are offered on a regular basis.\n\nMTH301 Introduction to Mathematical Proof\nMTH311 Probability Theory and an Introduction to Mathematical Statistics\n\nProbabilistic models are used in a variety of fields and applications including randomized algorithms, analysis of financial markets and quantum mechanics.This course provides the fundamental framework through illustrative and practical examples.\n\nMTH 330 Applied Mathematical Analysis I or MTH 334 Differential Equations\n\nThe language of rates allows one to model the physical systems arising from real-world phenomena. These courses introduce the student to the analytical methods and techniques used in solving systems of differential equations.\n\nMTH338 Linear Algebra\n\nSystems of linear equations and their solutions are studied in depth in this course. Concepts are taught at both a hands-on and abstract level with applications to problems in physics, engineering, economics and the social sciences.\n\nMTH339 Abstract Algebra\n\nGroup theory and ring theory allow one to analyze a variety of problems in mathematics and computer science from the viewpoints of abstraction and application. For example, students may prove basic results in group theory and apply these results to codes that are used on computers.\n\nMTH341 Advanced Calculus I\n\nThese courses provide the theoretical basis of modern analysis by taking a more general look at the key concepts of calculus including continuous functions, differentiable functions and integration theory\n\n\n\nMajors need 3 upper-level elective courses chosen from among the following. These courses are offered on a rotating basis.\n\nMTH306 History of Math\n\nLearn about mathematics by studying the development of mathematical ideas and techniques from antiquity through the eighteenth century. Topics involve arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry and will be drawn from Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, Hindu, Arabian and European mathematics.\n\nMTH 329 Geometry\n\nFundamental concepts in Euclidean geometry in two and three dimensions and non-Euclidean geometry are covered with applications to image processing and map-making. Topics include classical axiomatic geometry, classification of polygons and polyhedra, and representation of curves and surfaces.\n\nMTH 331 Differential Equations\n\nThe language of rates allows one to model the physical systems arising from real-world phenomena. These courses introduce the student to the analytical methods and techniques used in solving systems of differential equations\n\nMTH335 Numerical Analysis (Required for the CS -Math BS degree)\n\nSince the advent of the computers, algorithms have been developed to approximate numerical solutions to large-scale systems. This course introduces the student to the primary algorithms and tackles issues concerning computational efficiency, stability and error analysis.\n\nMTH337 Combinatorics and Graph Theory\n\nMany problems of a discrete nature, such as finding optimal postal routes and frequency assignments, are analyzed with graph theory. This course introduces the basic framework and shows how different problems can be solved within this.\n\nMTH 342 Advanced Calculus II\n\nContinuation of MTH 341\n\nMTH 347 Number Theory\n\nProblems from many branches of mathematics often reduce to the investigation of properties of a particular set of numbers; for example, the set of integer solutions to a certain equation. This course covers many elegant results from number theory, including some applications to cryptography.\n\nMTH 349 Introduction to Cryptology\n\nCryptography is the study of concealing information, and is often called encryption and decryption. Cryptology is the study of the principles, techniques, other uses, and history of cryptography. This includes cryptanalysis, the study of breaking encryption schemes and finding weaknesses in security. In this course, the student will learn several historical cryptosystems and the modern math one would use to break them. This course has substantive overlap with MTH 347 (Number Theory), MTH 339 (Abstract Algebra), and MTH 311 (Probability).\n\nMTH 350 Logic\n\nWhat is an algorithm? When is a function computable? When is a question decidable? Computability theory, a part of logic, shows that some functions are not computable and some questions are not decidable.\n\nMTH 370 Operations Research\n\nMany decision-making problems can be modeled as linear optimization problems with constraints. Simplex method is used to find optimal solutions for these problems. Transportation problem is discussed as well.\n\nMTH 372 Practical Machine Learning\n\nAmazon’s and Netflix’ recommendations. Google’s automatic translations. Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and Cortana. All of these run on a common set of technologies: Machine Learning. Using a blend of software engineering and modern statistics, Machine Learning algorithms extract patterns from (possibly very large) data sets and generate likely functions that describe these patterns.\nIn this course, we will learn the basics of Machine Learning through hands-on implementation. By participating in competitions on Kaggle we will learn how to build a Machine Learning algorithm using the standard tools in the field as well as the theory that fuels the methods in the first place.\nThe course covers supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering and regression problems, and takes you through team work through 4 different competition tasks to build Machine Learning pipelines to take you all the way from raw data to predictions with prediction quality scoring.\n\nMTH 410 Mathematical Statistics I\n\nStatistics and Probability are closely coupled fields that deal with uncertainty and undeterministic processes in a way most mathematics does not engage with: Probability gives us a language and toolbox to model randomness and uncertainty, while Statistics gives us a toolbox to match probabilistic tools to concretely observed data as well as the ability to quantify our degree of certainty and perform quality control on our models.\nIn this course, we study statistics from a mathematical foundations perspective. Starting with the problem of how to estimate unknown quantities, and the ways that we can describe the quality of our estimators, the course continues to a formal theory of hypothesis testing and derives most tests that occur in a practical statistics course directly from properties of estimators and tests generated from them.\nMany statistics courses will tell you how to test a claim using data. This course will tell you why these tests work.\n\nMTH 411 Mathematical Statistics II\n\nContinuation of MTH 410\n\nMTH 415 Mathematical Biology\n\nThis course involves the growing interaction between mathematics and the biological sciences and provides a practical context for the mathematical description\n\nMTH 416 Mathematics of Finance\n\nMathematical techniques for solving problems arising in finance and financial markets are covered. Students will develop financial models and apply mathematical methods to concrete problems.\n\nMTH 430 Partial Differential Equations\n\nTopics covered include first-order equations and the method of characteristics, canonical forms of second-order equations and the analysis of prototype hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptic equations with applications to mathematical physics and engineering.\n\nMTH 431 Complex Analysis\n\nThe complex numbers extend the real numbers in magical ways. This course introduces the student to functions that depend on a complex variable and take values in the complex plane.\n\nMTH 435 Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos\n\nWhy is the weather forecast accurate only once every few days? Is tossing a coin really random? Techniques used to address these and similar questions are introduced with concrete examples in physics, biology and engineering.\n\nMTH 437 Mathematical Modeling\n\nThis course explores the essential components of constructing a mathematical model, from problem identification and variable selection to model analysis and refinement. The aim is to provide experience in the process of building useful models in a variety of real world settings.\n\nMTH 440 Foundations of Mathematics\n\nIs every true statement provable? Mathematical logic, the study of truth and provability, shows that axioms can be true in different ways, in different models. Fuzzy logic allows for bizarre intermediate truth values between true and false\n\nMTH 441 Topology\n\nTopology involves the study of geometrical properties using analytical and algebraic tools. This course introduces the basic framework.\n\nMTH 442 Abstract Algebra II\n\nRings, integral domains, fields. Introduction to Galois theory.\n\nMTH 445 Differential Geometry\n\nDifferential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the methods of differential and integral calculus to study problems in geometry.\nUsing the analytical tools of calculus, Euler and Lagrange were able to understand what are the curves on a surface that minimize the distance between two points. A main question is how those curves can be determined by using intrinsic measurement of the surfaces. In that direction, Gauss in 1825 made some fundamental contributions to theory of surfaces. His papers contain practical calculations of the curvature of the earth based purely on measurements made on the surface. He considered also properties of surfaces which are determined only by the geodesic distances between points on the surface independently of the particular way in which the surface is located in the ambient Euclidean space. This led to his Theorema Egregium, a fundamental result which explains why there cannot be an accurate planar map of the world.\n \nDifferential Geometry allows also to explain and describe the beautiful surfaces created by playing with soap bubbles. They are in fact examples of “minimal surfaces”, a family of geometrical object that turns out to be quite relevant in applications. The above picture is the famous “catenoid” already studied by Euler.\nIn the applied world, Differential Geometry allows to design shapes used in everyday life, and is helpful when looking for a minimal path on curved surfaces. In physics, it allows to describe complicated physical systems leading to the Lagrangian formalism and General Relativity. The success of these theories makes Differential Geometry one of the fundamental tools in modern physics.\n\n\n\n\nStudents who wish to focus on theoretical aspects of mathematics are advised to include courses from Differential Equations, Real and Complex Analysis (MTH 331, MTH 342, MTH 431), Number Theory and Algebra (MTH 347, MTH 442), Geometry and Topology (MTH 329, MTH 441), or Logic and Foundations (MTH 350, MTH 440).\n\n\n\nStudents who wish to explore mathematical topics that have applications to other fields, including sciences, engineering, medicine, economics, or business, are advised to include courses that emphasize Mathematical Modeling such as Combinatorics/Graph Theory, Actuarial Mathematics, Operations Research and Mathematical Biology (MTH 337, MTH 360, MTH 370, MTH 415), Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems (MTH 331, MTH 435), Numerical Analysis (MTH 335), Mathematical Statistics (MTH 410, MTH 411), or Mathematics of Finance (MTH 416).\n\n\n\nTo graduate with honors in Mathematics a student must have at least a 3.5 grade point average in Mathematics courses and must complete an honors thesis or project. The student must work closely with a Mathematics faculty member to define the project, carry out the research and investigation, and write the final report or prepare the final project. The student may receive credit through Independent Study for work on an honors project. The project must be accepted by the Honors Committee of the Department of Mathematics."

With approximately 25 full-time faculty members representing a number of the major fields of current research, the department offers courses for mathematics, engineering, and science students, as well as service courses for the general student body (see the full list of courses). We offer Bachelor of Science degrees with an emphasis on graduate school preparation, secondary school teaching, and a joint degree with computer science.\n\n\n\n\nMany of our majors become involved in faculty-mentored undergraduate research projects. Our full-time faculty conduct research in a variety of areas of pure and applied mathematics (MathSciNet). Research areas include applied mathematics, differential geometry, discrete mathematics, geometric analysis, hyperbolic conservation laws, knot theory, logic, nonlinear analysis, number theory, probability, and topology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe College is conveniently located at the nexus of the vibrant New York City area research community. Many faculty in the Department of Mathematics contribute to, and organize, research activities at the CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan. Our faculty also supervise doctoral students at the Graduate Center, and participate in research seminars and colloquia with neighboring institutions."

    "text": "The Undergraduate Catalog lists the requirements of the Math Major. The Catalog also lists the requirements of the Math Minor.\nHere we describe the requirements more informally.\n\n\nBoth the Math Major and Minor require a student to complete the pre-major requirements. These include the calculus sequence, a computer science or statistics course.\nThe major has some expectations on how a student fulfills their general education requirements. In particular there is an expectation of a one-year science course chosen from a select list.\n\n\n\nThe Bachelor in Science of Mathematics and Mathematics 7-12 Bachelor of Science degrees are available. The latter requires an additional 24 credits in an Education Sequence and some required elective upper-level courses (below).\n\n\nTo earn a Major in Mathematics there is an expectation of nine upper-level math courses beyond the pre-major. Six of these courses are required and described below. These courses are offered on a regular basis.\n\nMTH301 Introduction to Mathematical Proof\nMTH311 Probability Theory and an Introduction to Mathematical Statistics\n\nProbabilistic models are used in a variety of fields and applications including randomized algorithms, analysis of financial markets and quantum mechanics.This course provides the fundamental framework through illustrative and practical examples.\n\nMTH 330 Applied Mathematical Analysis I or MTH 334 Differential Equations\n\nThe language of rates allows one to model the physical systems arising from real-world phenomena. These courses introduce the student to the analytical methods and techniques used in solving systems of differential equations.\n\nMTH338 Linear Algebra\n\nSystems of linear equations and their solutions are studied in depth in this course. Concepts are taught at both a hands-on and abstract level with applications to problems in physics, engineering, economics and the social sciences.\n\nMTH339 Abstract Algebra\n\nGroup theory and ring theory allow one to analyze a variety of problems in mathematics and computer science from the viewpoints of abstraction and application. For example, students may prove basic results in group theory and apply these results to codes that are used on computers.\n\nMTH341 Advanced Calculus I\n\nThese courses provide the theoretical basis of modern analysis by taking a more general look at the key concepts of calculus including continuous functions, differentiable functions and integration theory\n\n\n\nMajors need 3 upper-level elective courses chosen from among the following. These courses are offered on a rotating basis.\n\nMTH306 History of Math\n\nLearn about mathematics by studying the development of mathematical ideas and techniques from antiquity through the eighteenth century. Topics involve arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry and will be drawn from Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, Hindu, Arabian and European mathematics.\n\nMTH 329 Geometry\n\nFundamental concepts in Euclidean geometry in two and three dimensions and non-Euclidean geometry are covered with applications to image processing and map-making. Topics include classical axiomatic geometry, classification of polygons and polyhedra, and representation of curves and surfaces.\n\nMTH 331 Differential Equations\n\nThe language of rates allows one to model the physical systems arising from real-world phenomena. These courses introduce the student to the analytical methods and techniques used in solving systems of differential equations\n\nMTH335 Numerical Analysis (Required for the CS -Math BS degree)\n\nSince the advent of the computers, algorithms have been developed to approximate numerical solutions to large-scale systems. This course introduces the student to the primary algorithms and tackles issues concerning computational efficiency, stability and error analysis.\n\nMTH337 Combinatorics and Graph Theory\n\nMany problems of a discrete nature, such as finding optimal postal routes and frequency assignments, are analyzed with graph theory. This course introduces the basic framework and shows how different problems can be solved within this.\n\nMTH 342 Advanced Calculus II\n\nContinuation of MTH 341\n\nMTH 347 Number Theory\n\nProblems from many branches of mathematics often reduce to the investigation of properties of a particular set of numbers; for example, the set of integer solutions to a certain equation. This course covers many elegant results from number theory, including some applications to cryptography.\n\nMTH 349 Introduction to Cryptology\n\nCryptography is the study of concealing information, and is often called encryption and decryption. Cryptology is the study of the principles, techniques, other uses, and history of cryptography. This includes cryptanalysis, the study of breaking encryption schemes and finding weaknesses in security. In this course, the student will learn several historical cryptosystems and the modern math one would use to break them. This course has substantive overlap with MTH 347 (Number Theory), MTH 339 (Abstract Algebra), and MTH 311 (Probability).\n\nMTH 350 Logic\n\nWhat is an algorithm? When is a function computable? When is a question decidable? Computability theory, a part of logic, shows that some functions are not computable and some questions are not decidable.\n\nMTH 370 Operations Research\n\nMany decision-making problems can be modeled as linear optimization problems with constraints. Simplex method is used to find optimal solutions for these problems. Transportation problem is discussed as well.\n\nMTH 372 Practical Machine Learning\n\nAmazon’s and Netflix’ recommendations. Google’s automatic translations. Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and Cortana. All of these run on a common set of technologies: Machine Learning. Using a blend of software engineering and modern statistics, Machine Learning algorithms extract patterns from (possibly very large) data sets and generate likely functions that describe these patterns.\nIn this course, we will learn the basics of Machine Learning through hands-on implementation. By participating in competitions on Kaggle we will learn how to build a Machine Learning algorithm using the standard tools in the field as well as the theory that fuels the methods in the first place.\nThe course covers supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering and regression problems, and takes you through team work through 4 different competition tasks to build Machine Learning pipelines to take you all the way from raw data to predictions with prediction quality scoring.\n\nMTH 410 Mathematical Statistics I\n\nStatistics and Probability are closely coupled fields that deal with uncertainty and undeterministic processes in a way most mathematics does not engage with: Probability gives us a language and toolbox to model randomness and uncertainty, while Statistics gives us a toolbox to match probabilistic tools to concretely observed data as well as the ability to quantify our degree of certainty and perform quality control on our models.\nIn this course, we study statistics from a mathematical foundations perspective. Starting with the problem of how to estimate unknown quantities, and the ways that we can describe the quality of our estimators, the course continues to a formal theory of hypothesis testing and derives most tests that occur in a practical statistics course directly from properties of estimators and tests generated from them.\nMany statistics courses will tell you how to test a claim using data. This course will tell you why these tests work.\n\nMTH 411 Mathematical Statistics II\n\nContinuation of MTH 410\n\nMTH 415 Mathematical Biology\n\nThis course involves the growing interaction between mathematics and the biological sciences and provides a practical context for the mathematical description\n\nMTH 416 Mathematics of Finance\n\nMathematical techniques for solving problems arising in finance and financial markets are covered. Students will develop financial models and apply mathematical methods to concrete problems.\n\nMTH 430 Partial Differential Equations\n\nTopics covered include first-order equations and the method of characteristics, canonical forms of second-order equations and the analysis of prototype hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptic equations with applications to mathematical physics and engineering.\n\nMTH 431 Complex Analysis\n\nThe complex numbers extend the real numbers in magical ways. This course introduces the student to functions that depend on a complex variable and take values in the complex plane.\n\nMTH 435 Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos\n\nWhy is the weather forecast accurate only once every few days? Is tossing a coin really random? Techniques used to address these and similar questions are introduced with concrete examples in physics, biology and engineering.\n\nMTH 437 Mathematical Modeling\n\nThis course explores the essential components of constructing a mathematical model, from problem identification and variable selection to model analysis and refinement. The aim is to provide experience in the process of building useful models in a variety of real world settings.\n\nMTH 440 Foundations of Mathematics\n\nIs every true statement provable? Mathematical logic, the study of truth and provability, shows that axioms can be true in different ways, in different models. Fuzzy logic allows for bizarre intermediate truth values between true and false\n\nMTH 441 Topology\n\nTopology involves the study of geometrical properties using analytical and algebraic tools. This course introduces the basic framework.\n\nMTH 442 Abstract Algebra II\n\nRings, integral domains, fields. Introduction to Galois theory.\n\nMTH 445 Differential Geometry\n\nDifferential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the methods of differential and integral calculus to study problems in geometry.\nUsing the analytical tools of calculus, Euler and Lagrange were able to understand what are the curves on a surface that minimize the distance between two points. A main question is how those curves can be determined by using intrinsic measurement of the surfaces. In that direction, Gauss in 1825 made some fundamental contributions to theory of surfaces. His papers contain practical calculations of the curvature of the earth based purely on measurements made on the surface. He considered also properties of surfaces which are determined only by the geodesic distances between points on the surface independently of the particular way in which the surface is located in the ambient Euclidean space. This led to his Theorema Egregium, a fundamental result which explains why there cannot be an accurate planar map of the world.\n \nDifferential Geometry allows also to explain and describe the beautiful surfaces created by playing with soap bubbles. They are in fact examples of “minimal surfaces”, a family of geometrical object that turns out to be quite relevant in applications. The above picture is the famous “catenoid” already studied by Euler.\nIn the applied world, Differential Geometry allows to design shapes used in everyday life, and is helpful when looking for a minimal path on curved surfaces. In physics, it allows to describe complicated physical systems leading to the Lagrangian formalism and General Relativity. The success of these theories makes Differential Geometry one of the fundamental tools in modern physics.\n\n\n\n\nStudents who wish to focus on theoretical aspects of mathematics are advised to include courses from Differential Equations, Real and Complex Analysis (MTH 331, MTH 342, MTH 431), Number Theory and Algebra (MTH 347, MTH 442), Geometry and Topology (MTH 329, MTH 441), or Logic and Foundations (MTH 350, MTH 440).\n\n\n\nStudents who wish to explore mathematical topics that have applications to other fields, including sciences, engineering, medicine, economics, or business, are advised to include courses that emphasize Mathematical Modeling such as Combinatorics/Graph Theory, Actuarial Mathematics, Operations Research and Mathematical Biology (MTH 337, MTH 360, MTH 370, MTH 415), Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems (MTH 331, MTH 435), Numerical Analysis (MTH 335), Mathematical Statistics (MTH 410, MTH 411), or Mathematics of Finance (MTH 416).\n\n\n\nTo graduate with honors in Mathematics a student must have at least a 3.5 grade point average in Mathematics courses and must complete an honors thesis or project. The student must work closely with a Mathematics faculty member to define the project, carry out the research and investigation, and write the final report or prepare the final project. The student may receive credit through Independent Study for work on an honors project. The project must be accepted by the Honors Committee of the Department of Mathematics."

    "text": "The Undergraduate Catalog lists the requirements of the Math Major. The Catalog also lists the requirements of the Math Minor.\nHere we describe the requirements more informally.\n\n\nBoth the Math Major and Minor require a student to complete the pre-major requirements. These include the calculus sequence, a computer science or statistics course.\nThe major has some expectations on how a student fulfills their general education requirements. In particular there is an expectation of a one-year science course chosen from a select list.\n\n\n\nThe Bachelor in Science of Mathematics and Mathematics 7-12 Bachelor of Science degrees are available. The latter requires an additional 24 credits in an Education Sequence and some required elective upper-level courses (below).\n\n\nTo earn a Major in Mathematics there is an expectation of nine upper-level math courses beyond the pre-major. Six of these courses are required and described below. These courses are offered on a regular basis.\n\nMTH301 Introduction to Mathematical Proof\nMTH311 Probability Theory and an Introduction to Mathematical Statistics\n\nProbabilistic models are used in a variety of fields and applications including randomized algorithms, analysis of financial markets and quantum mechanics.This course provides the fundamental framework through illustrative and practical examples.\n\nMTH 330 Applied Mathematical Analysis I or MTH 334 Differential Equations\n\nThe language of rates allows one to model the physical systems arising from real-world phenomena. These courses introduce the student to the analytical methods and techniques used in solving systems of differential equations.\n\nMTH338 Linear Algebra\n\nSystems of linear equations and their solutions are studied in depth in this course. Concepts are taught at both a hands-on and abstract level with applications to problems in physics, engineering, economics and the social sciences.\n\nMTH339 Abstract Algebra\n\nGroup theory and ring theory allow one to analyze a variety of problems in mathematics and computer science from the viewpoints of abstraction and application. For example, students may prove basic results in group theory and apply these results to codes that are used on computers.\n\nMTH341 Advanced Calculus I\n\nThese courses provide the theoretical basis of modern analysis by taking a more general look at the key concepts of calculus including continuous functions, differentiable functions and integration theory\n\n\n\nMajors need 3 upper-level elective courses chosen from among the following. These courses are offered on a rotating basis.\n\nMTH306 History of Math\n\nLearn about mathematics by studying the development of mathematical ideas and techniques from antiquity through the eighteenth century. Topics involve arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry and will be drawn from Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, Hindu, Arabian and European mathematics.\n\nMTH 329 Geometry\n\nFundamental concepts in Euclidean geometry in two and three dimensions and non-Euclidean geometry are covered with applications to image processing and map-making. Topics include classical axiomatic geometry, classification of polygons and polyhedra, and representation of curves and surfaces.\n\nMTH 331 Differential Equations\n\nThe language of rates allows one to model the physical systems arising from real-world phenomena. These courses introduce the student to the analytical methods and techniques used in solving systems of differential equations\n\nMTH335 Numerical Analysis (Required for the CS -Math BS degree)\n\nSince the advent of the computers, algorithms have been developed to approximate numerical solutions to large-scale systems. This course introduces the student to the primary algorithms and tackles issues concerning computational efficiency, stability and error analysis.\n\nMTH337 Combinatorics and Graph Theory\n\nMany problems of a discrete nature, such as finding optimal postal routes and frequency assignments, are analyzed with graph theory. This course introduces the basic framework and shows how different problems can be solved within this.\n\nMTH 342 Advanced Calculus II\n\nContinuation of MTH 341\n\nMTH 347 Number Theory\n\nProblems from many branches of mathematics often reduce to the investigation of properties of a particular set of numbers; for example, the set of integer solutions to a certain equation. This course covers many elegant results from number theory, including some applications to cryptography.\n\nMTH 349 Introduction to Cryptology\n\nCryptography is the study of concealing information, and is often called encryption and decryption. Cryptology is the study of the principles, techniques, other uses, and history of cryptography. This includes cryptanalysis, the study of breaking encryption schemes and finding weaknesses in security. In this course, the student will learn several historical cryptosystems and the modern math one would use to break them. This course has substantive overlap with MTH 347 (Number Theory), MTH 339 (Abstract Algebra), and MTH 311 (Probability).\n\nMTH 350 Logic\n\nWhat is an algorithm? When is a function computable? When is a question decidable? Computability theory, a part of logic, shows that some functions are not computable and some questions are not decidable.\n\nMTH 370 Operations Research\n\nMany decision-making problems can be modeled as linear optimization problems with constraints. Simplex method is used to find optimal solutions for these problems. Transportation problem is discussed as well.\n\nMTH 372 Practical Machine Learning\n\nAmazon’s and Netflix’ recommendations. Google’s automatic translations. Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and Cortana. All of these run on a common set of technologies: Machine Learning. Using a blend of software engineering and modern statistics, Machine Learning algorithms extract patterns from (possibly very large) data sets and generate likely functions that describe these patterns.\nIn this course, we will learn the basics of Machine Learning through hands-on implementation. By participating in competitions on Kaggle we will learn how to build a Machine Learning algorithm using the standard tools in the field as well as the theory that fuels the methods in the first place.\nThe course covers supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering and regression problems, and takes you through team work through 4 different competition tasks to build Machine Learning pipelines to take you all the way from raw data to predictions with prediction quality scoring.\n\nMTH 410 Mathematical Statistics I\n\nStatistics and Probability are closely coupled fields that deal with uncertainty and undeterministic processes in a way most mathematics does not engage with: Probability gives us a language and toolbox to model randomness and uncertainty, while Statistics gives us a toolbox to match probabilistic tools to concretely observed data as well as the ability to quantify our degree of certainty and perform quality control on our models.\nIn this course, we study statistics from a mathematical foundations perspective. Starting with the problem of how to estimate unknown quantities, and the ways that we can describe the quality of our estimators, the course continues to a formal theory of hypothesis testing and derives most tests that occur in a practical statistics course directly from properties of estimators and tests generated from them.\nMany statistics courses will tell you how to test a claim using data. This course will tell you why these tests work.\n\nMTH 411 Mathematical Statistics II\n\nContinuation of MTH 410\n\nMTH 415 Mathematical Biology\n\nThis course involves the growing interaction between mathematics and the biological sciences and provides a practical context for the mathematical description\n\nMTH 416 Mathematics of Finance\n\nMathematical techniques for solving problems arising in finance and financial markets are covered. Students will develop financial models and apply mathematical methods to concrete problems.\n\nMTH 430 Partial Differential Equations\n\nTopics covered include first-order equations and the method of characteristics, canonical forms of second-order equations and the analysis of prototype hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptic equations with applications to mathematical physics and engineering.\n\nMTH 431 Complex Analysis\n\nThe complex numbers extend the real numbers in magical ways. This course introduces the student to functions that depend on a complex variable and take values in the complex plane.\n\nMTH 435 Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos\n\nWhy is the weather forecast accurate only once every few days? Is tossing a coin really random? Techniques used to address these and similar questions are introduced with concrete examples in physics, biology and engineering.\n\nMTH 437 Mathematical Modeling\n\nThis course explores the essential components of constructing a mathematical model, from problem identification and variable selection to model analysis and refinement. The aim is to provide experience in the process of building useful models in a variety of real world settings.\n\nMTH 440 Foundations of Mathematics\n\nIs every true statement provable? Mathematical logic, the study of truth and provability, shows that axioms can be true in different ways, in different models. Fuzzy logic allows for bizarre intermediate truth values between true and false\n\nMTH 441 Topology\n\nTopology involves the study of geometrical properties using analytical and algebraic tools. This course introduces the basic framework.\n\nMTH 442 Abstract Algebra II\n\nRings, integral domains, fields. Introduction to Galois theory.\n\nMTH 445 Differential Geometry\n\nDifferential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the methods of differential and integral calculus to study problems in geometry.\nUsing the analytical tools of calculus, Euler and Lagrange were able to understand what are the curves on a surface that minimize the distance between two points. A main question is how those curves can be determined by using intrinsic measurement of the surfaces. In that direction, Gauss in 1825 made some fundamental contributions to theory of surfaces. His papers contain practical calculations of the curvature of the earth based purely on measurements made on the surface. He considered also properties of surfaces which are determined only by the geodesic distances between points on the surface independently of the particular way in which the surface is located in the ambient Euclidean space. This led to his Theorema Egregium, a fundamental result which explains why there cannot be an accurate planar map of the world.\n \nDifferential Geometry allows also to explain and describe the beautiful surfaces created by playing with soap bubbles. They are in fact examples of “minimal surfaces”, a family of geometrical object that turns out to be quite relevant in applications. The above picture is the famous “catenoid” already studied by Euler.\nIn the applied world, Differential Geometry allows to design shapes used in everyday life, and is helpful when looking for a minimal path on curved surfaces. In physics, it allows to describe complicated physical systems leading to the Lagrangian formalism and General Relativity. The success of these theories makes Differential Geometry one of the fundamental tools in modern physics.\n\n\n\n\nStudents who wish to focus on theoretical aspects of mathematics are advised to include courses from Differential Equations, Real and Complex Analysis (MTH 331, MTH 342, MTH 431), Number Theory and Algebra (MTH 347, MTH 442), Geometry and Topology (MTH 329, MTH 441), or Logic and Foundations (MTH 350, MTH 440).\n\n\n\nStudents who wish to explore mathematical topics that have applications to other fields, including sciences, engineering, medicine, economics, or business, are advised to include courses that emphasize Mathematical Modeling such as Combinatorics/Graph Theory, Actuarial Mathematics, Operations Research and Mathematical Biology (MTH 337, MTH 360, MTH 370, MTH 415), Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems (MTH 331, MTH 435), Numerical Analysis (MTH 335), Mathematical Statistics (MTH 410, MTH 411), or Mathematics of Finance (MTH 416).\n\n\n\nTo graduate with honors in Mathematics a student must have at least a 3.5 grade point average in Mathematics courses and must complete an honors thesis or project. The student must work closely with a Mathematics faculty member to define the project, carry out the research and investigation, and write the final report or prepare the final project. The student may receive credit through Independent Study for work on an honors project. The project must be accepted by the Honors Committee of the Department of Mathematics."

Is tossing a coin really random? Techniques used to address these and similar questions are introduced with concrete examples in physics, biology and engineering.\n\nMTH 437 Mathematical Modeling\n\nThis course explores the essential components of constructing a mathematical model, from problem identification and variable selection to model analysis and refinement. The aim is to provide experience in the process of building useful models in a variety of real world settings.\n\nMTH 440 Foundations of Mathematics\n\nIs every true statement provable? Mathematical logic, the study of truth and provability, shows that axioms can be true in different ways, in different models. Fuzzy logic allows for bizarre intermediate truth values between true and false\n\nMTH 441 Topology\n\nTopology involves the study of geometrical properties using analytical and algebraic tools. This course introduces the basic framework.\n\nMTH 442 Abstract Algebra II\n\nRings, integral domains, fields. Introduction to Galois theory.\n\nMTH 445 Differential Geometry\n\nDifferential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the methods of differential and integral calculus to study problems in geometry.\nUsing the analytical tools of calculus, Euler and Lagrange were able to understand what are the curves on a surface that minimize the distance between two points. A main question is how those curves can be determined by using intrinsic measurement of the surfaces. In that direction, Gauss in 1825 made some fundamental contributions to theory of surfaces. His papers contain practical calculations of the curvature of the earth based purely on measurements made on the surface. He considered also properties of surfaces which are determined only by the geodesic distances between points on the surface independently of the particular way in which the surface is located in the ambient Euclidean space. This led to his Theorema Egregium, a fundamental result which explains why there cannot be an accurate planar map of the world.\n \nDifferential Geometry allows also to explain and describe the beautiful surfaces created by playing with soap bubbles. They are in fact examples of “minimal surfaces”, a family of geometrical object that turns out to be quite relevant in applications. The above picture is the famous “catenoid” already studied by Euler.\nIn the applied world, Differential Geometry allows to design shapes used in everyday life, and is helpful when looking for a minimal path on curved surfaces. In physics, it allows to describe complicated physical systems leading to the Lagrangian formalism and General Relativity. The success of these theories makes Differential Geometry one of the fundamental tools in modern physics."
