The latter requires an additional 24 credits in an Education Sequence and some required elective upper-level courses (below).\n\nNon-elective upper-level courses\nTo earn a Major in Mathematics there is an expectation of nine upper-level math courses beyond the pre-major. Six of these courses are required and described below. These courses are offered on a regular basis.\n\nMTH301 Introduction to Mathematical Proof\nMTH311 Probability Theory and an Introduction to Mathematical Statistics\n\nProbabilistic models are used in a variety of fields and applications including randomized algorithms, analysis of financial markets and quantum mechanics.This course provides the fundamental framework through illustrative and practical examples.\n\nMTH 330 Applied Mathematical Analysis I or MTH 334 Differential Equations\n\nThe language of rates allows one to model the physical systems arising from real-world phenomena. These courses introduce the student to the analytical methods and techniques used in solving systems of differential equations.\n\nMTH338 Linear Algebra\n\nSystems of linear equations and their solutions are studied in depth in this course. Concepts are taught at both a hands-on and abstract level with applications to problems in physics, engineering, economics and the social sciences.\n\nMTH339 Abstract Algebra\n\nGroup theory and ring theory allow one to analyze a variety of problems in mathematics and computer science from the viewpoints of abstraction and application. For example, students may prove basic results in group theory and apply these results to codes that are used on computers.\n\nMTH341 Advanced Calculus I\n\nThese courses provide the theoretical basis of modern analysis by taking a more general look at the key concepts of calculus including continuous functions, differentiable functions and integration theory\n\n\nElective upper-level courses\nMajors need 3 upper-level elective courses chosen from among the following. These courses are offered on a rotating basis.\n\nMTH306 History of Math\n\nLearn about mathematics by studying the development of mathematical ideas and techniques from antiquity through the eighteenth century. Topics involve arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry and will be drawn from Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, Hindu, Arabian and European mathematics.\n\nMTH 329 Geometry\n\nFundamental concepts in Euclidean geometry in two and three dimensions and non-Euclidean geometry are covered with applications to image processing and map-making. Topics include classical axiomatic geometry, classification of polygons and polyhedra, and representation of curves and surfaces.\n\nMTH 331 Differential Equations\n\nThe language of rates allows one to model the physical systems arising from real-world phenomena. These courses introduce the student to the analytical methods and techniques used in solving systems of differential equations\n\nMTH335 Numerical Analysis (Required for the CS -Math BS degree)\n\nSince the advent of the computers, algorithms have been developed to approximate numerical solutions to large-scale systems. This course introduces the student to the primary algorithms and tackles issues concerning computational efficiency, stability and error analysis.\n\nMTH337 Combinatorics and Graph Theory\n\nMany problems of a discrete nature, such as finding optimal postal routes and frequency assignments, are analyzed with graph theory. This course introduces the basic framework and shows how different problems can be solved within this.\n\nMTH 342 Advanced Calculus II\n\nContinuation of MTH 341\n\nMTH 347 Number Theory\n\nProblems from many branches of mathematics often reduce to the investigation of properties of a particular set of numbers; for example, the set of integer solutions to a certain equation. This course covers many elegant results from number theory, including some applications to cryptography.\n\nMTH 349 Introduction to Cryptology\n\nCryptography is the study of concealing information, and is often called encryption and decryption. Cryptology is the study of the principles, techniques, other uses, and history of cryptography. This includes cryptanalysis, the study of breaking encryption schemes and finding weaknesses in security. In this course, the student will learn several historical cryptosystems and the modern math one would use to break them. This course has substantive overlap with MTH 347 (Number Theory), MTH 339 (Abstract Algebra), and MTH 311 (Probability).\n\nMTH 350 Logic\n\nWhat is an algorithm? When is a function computable? When is a question decidable? Computability theory, a part of logic, shows that some functions are not computable and some questions are not decidable.\n\nMTH 370 Operations Research\n\nMany decision-making problems can be modeled as linear optimization problems with constraints. Simplex method is used to find optimal solutions for these problems. Transportation problem is discussed as well.\n\nMTH 372 Practical Machine Learning\n\nAmazon’s and Netflix’ recommendations. Google’s automatic translations. Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and Cortana. All of these run on a common set of technologies: Machine Learning. Using a blend of software engineering and modern statistics, Machine Learning algorithms extract patterns from (possibly very large) data sets and generate likely functions that describe these patterns.\nIn this course, we will learn the basics of Machine Learning through hands-on implementation. By participating in competitions on Kaggle we will learn how to build a Machine Learning algorithm using the standard tools in the field as well as the theory that fuels the methods in the first place.\nThe course covers supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering and regression problems, and takes you through team work through 4 different competition tasks to build Machine Learning pipelines to take you all the way from raw data to predictions with prediction quality scoring.\n\nMTH 410 Mathematical Statistics I\n\nStatistics and Probability are closely coupled fields that deal with uncertainty and undeterministic processes in a way most mathematics does not engage with: Probability gives us a language and toolbox to model randomness and uncertainty, while Statistics gives us a toolbox to match probabilistic tools to concretely observed data as well as the ability to quantify our degree of certainty and perform quality control on our models.\nIn this course, we study statistics from a mathematical foundations perspective. Starting with the problem of how to estimate unknown quantities, and the ways that we can describe the quality of our estimators, the course continues to a formal theory of hypothesis testing and derives most tests that occur in a practical statistics course directly from properties of estimators and tests generated from them.\nMany statistics courses will tell you how to test a claim using data. This course will tell you why these tests work.\n\nMTH 411 Mathematical Statistics II\n\nContinuation of MTH 410\n\nMTH 415 Mathematical Biology\n\nThis course involves the growing interaction between mathematics and the biological sciences and provides a practical context for the mathematical description\n\nMTH 416 Mathematics of Finance\n\nMathematical techniques for solving problems arising in finance and financial markets are covered. Students will develop financial models and apply mathematical methods to concrete problems.\n\nMTH 430 Partial Differential Equations\n\nTopics covered include first-order equations and the method of characteristics, canonical forms of second-order equations and the analysis of prototype hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptic equations with applications to mathematical physics and engineering.\n\nMTH 431 Complex Analysis\n\nThe complex numbers extend the real numbers in magical ways. This course introduces the student to functions that depend on a complex variable and take values in the complex plane.\n\nMTH 435 Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos\n\nWhy is the weather forecast accurate only once every few days? Is tossing a coin really random? Techniques used to address these and similar questions are introduced with concrete examples in physics, biology and engineering.\n\nMTH 437 Mathematical Modeling\n\nThis course explores the essential components of constructing a mathematical model, from problem identification and variable selection to model analysis and refinement. The aim is to provide experience in the process of building useful models in a variety of real world settings.\n\nMTH 440 Foundations of Mathematics\n\nIs every true statement provable? Mathematical logic, the study of truth and provability, shows that axioms can be true in different ways, in different models. Fuzzy logic allows for bizarre intermediate truth values between true and false\n\nMTH 441 Topology\n\nTopology involves the study of geometrical properties using analytical and algebraic tools. This course introduces the basic framework.\n\nMTH 442 Abstract Algebra II\n\nRings, integral domains, fields. Introduction to Galois theory.\n\nMTH 445 Differential Geometry\n\nDifferential geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the methods of differential and integral calculus to study problems in geometry.\nUsing the analytical tools of calculus, Euler and Lagrange were able to understand what are the curves on a surface that minimize the distance between two points. A main question is how those curves can be determined by using intrinsic measurement of the surfaces. In that direction, Gauss in 1825 made some fundamental contributions to theory of surfaces. His papers contain practical calculations of the curvature of the earth based purely on measurements made on the surface. He considered also properties of surfaces which are determined only by the geodesic distances between points on the surface independently of the particular way in which the surface is located in the ambient Euclidean space. This led to his Theorema Egregium, a fundamental result which explains why there cannot be an accurate planar map of the world.\n \nDifferential Geometry allows also to explain and describe the beautiful surfaces created by playing with soap bubbles. They are in fact examples of “minimal surfaces”, a family of geometrical object that turns out to be quite relevant in applications. The above picture is the famous “catenoid” already studied by Euler.\nIn the applied world, Differential Geometry allows to design shapes used in everyday life, and is helpful when looking for a minimal path on curved surfaces. In physics, it allows to describe complicated physical systems leading to the Lagrangian formalism and General Relativity. The success of these theories makes Differential Geometry one of the fundamental tools in modern physics."

This led to the strong approximation of a wide class of additive functionals.Another related topic of investigation was on the measure of heavily visited points of the Brownian motion.\nRecently I got interested in the fine properties of the maximal local time and occupation time of the simple d-dimensional random walks. Questions about maximal local time on subsets, maximal occupation time of a finite set, multiplicity of the set of points with a given local time, and joint asymptotic behavior of local and occupation times of random walks in higher dimension are the object of my most recent work."

Statistical mechanics strives to understand how the properties of macroscopic physical systems arise from the interactions among huge numbers of microscopic entities, such as atoms and molecules. This type of question leads to fascinating and hard mathematical problems. In particular, Dr. Lancellotti has been working on the so-called kinetic theory of plasmas and gravitating systems. These are assemblies of many electrically charged particles (plasmas) or large populations of stars (galaxies, globular clusters) that interact through inverse-square forces (e.g. gravity). Over the years, physicists have assembled a body of beautiful theoretical models, called kinetic equations, that are supposed to describe mathematically the behavior of these systems. However, the current understanding of the solutions to these complicated differential equations is still very limited. Hence the need to apply advanced mathematical methods in order to investigate such solutions and compare them with the the phenomena that are observed in nature. Also, the mathematical analysis is often supplemented by numerical simulations that shed light on the nature of the solutions being investigated.\nAmong other things, Dr. Lancellotti has published research papers on wave propagation in plasmas and on the dynamics of clusters of stars. He is currently studying the equations that regulate energy dissipation in plasmas and gravitating system (Landau and Lenard-Balescu equations), and also the so-called Kuramoto model, that describes the dynamics of large assemblies of oscillating systems (for example, crickets, heart cells and other biological systems). His research is currently supported by a three-year grant from the National Science Foundation and also by a smaller PSC-CUNY grant, and is conducted in collaboration with other researchers both at the College of Staten Island and at other research institutions."

Furthermore, they provide applications to areas such as statistical mechanics, quantum chaos, knot theory and cryptography. Dr. Pribitkin’s subspecialty focuses on the Fourier coefficients of automorphic integrals. These coefficients often reveal remarkable properties of natural numbers.

Recently I and my co-authors have investigated a paradox, discovered by von Neumann in the 1940s, that involves the reflection of weak waves in a gas. Experiments show that when a weak shock wave reflects off a thin wedge, a reflection pattern consisting of three shock waves that meet at a “triple point” apparently occurs. Von Neumann showed, however, that such a point is impossible - it cannot conserve mass, momentum, and energy. Therefore, the apparent triple point must have an unknown local structure of small but finite size. To study this phenomenon, problems for several systems of conservation laws, including the Euler equations of gasdynamics, were formulated. Numerical solutions of these problems have led to a determination of the local structure near the apparent triple point, and theoretical analysis shows that this structure provides a resolution of the paradox. Recent experimental evidence appears to confirm this resolution.\nI received my PhD from the University of California, Davis in 2001.
