<!-- autogenerated --><h2>Role in Curriculum</h2>The course will be a mathematics elective for undergraduates interested in applied mathematics.<h2>Learning Goals and Assessment Plans</h2><table border=1 cellpadding='5'><tr><th>Learning Goal</th><th>Assessment</th><tr><tr><td align='left' valign='top'>The students will learn basic theory and<br>techniques for solving first order linear and<br>quasilinear PDE’s in two Independent variables.</td><td align='left' valign='top'>When the class is being assessed, the final exams<br>will include embedded questions to assess student<br>performance on these topic-specific learning<br>goals.
