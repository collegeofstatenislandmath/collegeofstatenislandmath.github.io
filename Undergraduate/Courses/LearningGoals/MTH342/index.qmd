## Role in Curriculum

Provides important tools to study and analyze multivariable functions

## Learning Goals and Assessment Plans

> The student will be able to prove that a
> multivariable map is continuous or
> differentiable.

When the class is being assessed, the final exams
will include embedded questions to assess student
performance on these topic-specific learning
goals. Instructors are resposible for tallying
their students scores.

> The student will be able to compute the Jacobian
> matrix of a given differentiable map.

same

> The student will be able to apply the Lagrange
> multiplier Theorem to find maximum or minimum
> values of a function subjected to a constraint.

When assessment activities are done, the results will be summarized in
memorandum form and filed with the department chairperson for record
keeping
purposes.

Information obtained from assessment will be used to assess and
self-reflect on the success of the course and to make any necessary
changes to
improve teaching and learning effectiveness.
