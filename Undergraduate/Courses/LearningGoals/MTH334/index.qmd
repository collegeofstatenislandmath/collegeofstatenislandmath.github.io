## Role in Curriculum

Required for the mathematics major.

## Learning Goals and Assessment Plans


> The student will be able to apply standard
> techniques for solving first-order ordinary
> differential equations (ODEs).

When the class is being assessed, the final exams
will include embedded questions to assess student
performance on these topic-specific learning
goals. Instructors are responsible for tallying
their students scores.

> The student will be able to apply ODEs to simple
> examples in mechanics (e.g., a harmonic
> oscillator) and biology (e.g., population
> dynamics).

same

> The student will be able to represent a
> higher-order ODE as a system of lower-order ODEs

When assessment activities are done, the results will be summarized in
memorandum form and filed with the department chairperson for record
keeping
purposes.

Information obtained from assessment will be used to assess and
self-reflect on the success of the course and to make any necessary
changes to
improve teaching and learning effectiveness.
