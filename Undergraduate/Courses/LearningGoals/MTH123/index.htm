<!-- autogenerated --><h2>Role in Curriculum</h2>MTH 123 is a college algebra / trigonometry class that provides mathematical skills necessary for<br>further success in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), business and teaching<br>majors. It satisfies the general education requirement. Moreover, MTH 123 prepares the students for<br>the next level of courses in mathematics, usually pre-calculus. The prerequisite is MTH 030 or an<br>appropriate score on the CUNY proficiency/placement exam taken by many students who stop at Regents<br>A<h2>Learning Goals and Assessment Plans</h2><table border=1 cellpadding='5'><tr><th>Learning Goal</th><th>Assessment</th><tr><tr><td align='left' valign='top'>Solve equations and manipulate expressions with<br>linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic and<br>trigonometric functions.</td><td align='left' valign='top'>When the class is being assessed, the final exams<br>will include embedded questions to assess student<br>performance on these topic-specific learning<br>goals.
