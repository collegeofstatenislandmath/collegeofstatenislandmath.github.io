<h2>Role in Curriculum</h2>
This course will introduce math majors to proof techniques and working on open ended problems, as a foundation for other proof based 300/400 level math courses, and as a preparation for undergraduate research projects.  This is a required course for mathematics majors
<h2>Learning Goals and Assessment Plans</h2>

<tr>
<th>Learning Goal</th>
<th>Assessment</th>

<tr>
<td align='left' valign='top'>Use basic set notation and quantifiers.</td>
<td align='left' valign='top'>When the class is being assessed, the final exams will include embedded questions to assess student performance on these topic-specific learning goals. Instructors will tally their students'
scores on these questions, and will forward this
data to the chair of the department pre-major
curriculum committee

<p>When assessment activities are done, the results will be summarized in memorandum form and filed with the department chairperson for record keeping purposes.</p>
	   <p>Information obtained from assessment will be used to assess and self-reflect on the success of the course and to make any necessary changes to improve teaching and learning effectiveness.</p>
