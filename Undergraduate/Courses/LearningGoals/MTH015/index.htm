<!-- autogenerated --><h2>Role in Curriculum</h2>First developmental-level math course for students who were not exempted from CUNY proficiency and<br>failed both parts I and II of the COMPASS placement exam used to assess CUNY proficiency. MTH 020<br>with similar learning goals, is for students who have passed at least one part of the COMPASS<br>placement exam. Students successfully passing both the COMPASS and the course content have similar<br>options as those passing MTH 020.<h2>Learning Goals and Assessment Plans</h2><table border=1 cellpadding='5'><tr><th>Learning Goal</th><th>Assessment</th><tr><tr><td align='left' valign='top'>The student will understand lines, including<br>solving linear equations, the concept of slope,<br>the point-slope formula, and graphing of lines</td><td align='left' valign='top'>When the class is being assessed, the common<br>final exams will include embedded questions to<br>assess whether the students have sufficiently<br>mastered the topic-specific learning goals.<br>Instructors will be responsible for tallying<br>their students performance on these questions,<br>and the developmental math coordinator will<br>provide an overall summary.</td></tr>
