<!-- autogenerated --><h2>Role in Curriculum</h2>One of MTH 330 and 334 required for the mathematics major.  Required for the Engineering Science<br>major and the Physics major.<h2>Learning Goals and Assessment Plans</h2><table border=1 cellpadding='5'><tr><th>Learning Goal</th><th>Assessment</th><tr><tr><td align='left' valign='top'>The student will be able to apply standard<br>techniques for solving first-order ordinary<br>differential equations (ODEs).</td><td align='left' valign='top'>When the class is being assessed, the final exams<br>will include embedded questions to assess student<br>performance on these topic-specific learning<br>goals.
