When assessment activities are done, the results will be summarized in
memorandum form and filed with the department chairperson for record
keeping
purposes.

Information obtained from assessment will be used to assess and
self-reflect on the success of the course and to make any necessary
changes to
improve teaching and learning effectiveness.
