</table><p>When assessment activities are done, the results will be summarized in memorandum form and filed with the department chairperson for record keeping<br>purposes.</p><p>Information obtained from assessment will be used to assess and self-reflect on the success of the course and to make any necessary changes to<br>improve teaching and learning effectiveness.</p><hr>Last updated Mon May 24 14:48:07 2010
