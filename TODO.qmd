# TODO

✓ github
✓ sidebar styling
✓ about pages are not very nice
* about pages need a space in the URL line after the icon
* calendar.csv needs updating
  - has to be copied manually each semester
  - get rid of altogether? Maybe link to the CSI calendar?
* News at the top?
* Syllabi needs a landing page
* Courses/index needs love (just generally)
* Advisement Documents page is kind of scary looking
* learning goals needs attention from the department
* Clean up Graduate and Research folders
