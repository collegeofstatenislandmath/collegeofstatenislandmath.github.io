## Biography

Broadly speaking, my research interest lies in analysis and applied
mathematics. More specifically, I am interested in partial
differential equations arising in fluid dynamics and materials
science. My current research focuses on some models for non-Newtonian
complex fluids, such as the Doi model arising in the theory of
nematic liquid crystalline polymers.
